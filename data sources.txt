        Cross County Bikeway Corridors
            could use to add/confirm bike lanes, but i think there was already an import for that
        Priority Corridors
            same as above? maybe existing, not proposed
    General Plan Land Use Webservice
        landuse=*
        also seems to work around streets
        would additionally need collation for all the cities

    Bike Paths Lanes Routes
        already imported?
    Bus 2018
        vta.py
        same as gtfs, would likely need transition to PTv2
        algorithm to determine routes for paths is complex. works… mostly. doesn't split ways.
        do NOT use to detect stops on route
    Bus Stop Inventory
        vta.py
        lots of really useful info, not all has (direct) translation
        could be a big conflation effort
        less necessary to move to PTv2
        if v2, not obvious if it should be stop position or platform (placement accuracy)
    CaltrainPnR
    GTFS/VTA GTFS Data File
        lots of good information, but current map is not v2, gtfs-osm-sync is not v2, gtfs-osm-sync doesn't find routes

    Sanitary Systems
        there is a spec for manholes, and even pipes, but not sure how useful it all is
        Sanitary Mains
        Sanitary Manholes
    Storm Systems
        marginally more useful than above, since detentions (basins) and culverts are above ground
        would need merging effort

        Manholes

        there's a spec, but not sure how useful
    Zoning
        zoning.py, expand.js
        landuse=*
        works around streets (needs lots of cleanup)

        fire/police stations, schools… has some address info, but some outdated, and all already mapped

        weird, but actually mostly unmapped! poor geolocating though
